# 🎯 Guessing Game

A simple Python word-guessing game where the computer randomly chooses a word from a predefined word bank, and the player must guess the hidden word one letter at a time.

## 🧩 How It Works

The program selects a random word from a list using Python’s built-in random module.

The player guesses one letter at a time.

If the letter exists in the word, it’s revealed in its correct position(s).

The game continues until the player correctly reveals the full word or runs out of attempts (if you add a limit).
